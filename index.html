    <h2>Robotices Systems and Internet of Things</h2>
    This course presents an overview of Robotic Systems (RS) and Internet of
    Things (IoT), and how these two systems can be integrated into a larger
    framework, Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In the first half of the
    semester, students gain knowledge and skills related to RS and IoT
    through lectures and hands-on problem sets that introduce how RS and IoT
    components work and how they can be linked. The hands-on problem sets
    use common RS/IoT components such as industrial robot manipulators,
    mobile robots, vision sensors, online databases, and mobile
    devices. Building on the general knowledge and skills thus gained,
    studentsãƒ»work in the second half of the semester is
    project-focused. Student teams of 4-5 members design, build, test and
    demonstrate either a component or a system of IoRT. Teams meet with the
    course instructors regularly to incrementally extend and improve their
    IoRT component/system. This course is intended for graduate and upper
    class undergraduate students who have already learned at least one of
    the technical skills related to RS (for example: mechanism design,
    kinematics, dynamics, mechatronics, sensors, control, and machine
    learning), and are familiar with at least one procedural programming
    language like C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python.
