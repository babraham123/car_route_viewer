** assembly starts

I finished bottom plate parts (4 motor, 1 motor amp, 3 line censors).

** Pi mount

Asked Ed to make 3 holes on the top plate to mount pi (he will make CAD
drawing for the preparation of next 14 car kits.) Once the course number is
decided, he wil charge it.

** Initial status

GPIO04 (pin 7) initial status: UP, others looks like low. Instead of PIN7, I use PIN12

** H bridge (L298N)

1. I need to short 2 connectors next to the 4 input pins.
2. H Bridge can generate 5V, connect PIN2 & PIN6 of GPIO to power raspberry pi
